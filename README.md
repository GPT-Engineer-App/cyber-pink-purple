# cyber-pink-purple

I want it to have a modern design, with a color palette dominated by pink and purple tones. I want it to look like something out of the Cyberpunk universe. The font should be sans-serif and the design should be responsive, meaning that it should be mobile-friendly.

The homepage should have the following elements: an image on the left side of the screen, an About Me section on the right side and icons of the systems I know and use. The text in the About Me section should be animated. 
Other features should include social media icons, animations and transitions.
